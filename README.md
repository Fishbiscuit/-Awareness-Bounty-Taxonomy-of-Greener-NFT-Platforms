# -Awareness-Bounty-Taxonomy-of-Greener-NFT-Platforms
# Green NFT Submission
## Introduction
This submission is working to solve the Awareness Bounty, specifically targeting the problem of information assymetry between artists and collectors using blockchain. 
This work **outlines a wide variety of current projects/solutions** and **explains how they reduce energy consumption of NFTs.** To serve as a consolidated resource with clear information on the **advantages of supporting greener options** to immediately reduce the impact of NFTs on the environment.

## The problems with Non-fungible Tokens (NFT) made simple
However there are several [problems](https://joanielemercier.com/the-problem-of-cryptoart/) with CryptoArt. They rely on the underlying blockchain networks that they exist on. These distributed networks run many nodes and lead to high levels of energy consumption.

### Environmental cost of Ethereum as an NFT platform
Ethereum is by far the most popular NFT platform. [Minting NFTs](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/#environmental-impact-nfts) on Ethereum takes a few steps: 
- The NFT needs to be confirmed as an asset on the Ethereum blockchain.
- The smart contract owner's account balance must be updated to include that asset, allowing it to be traded or verifiably owned.
- Each action takes a transaction to occur on the blockchain
- The block must be confirmed by everyone in the network

These actions can be calculated with [carbon footprint analysers](https://carbon.fyi/) and the numbers don't seem to be good. The [average transaction on ethereum is expected to cost about 35kWh](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption). [Memo Akten](https://memoakten.medium.com/) analysed [~80,000 transactions](https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053) on CryptoArt marketplace and concluded that the footprint of a single transaction relating to a NFT is 82 kWh, with emissions of 48 KgCO2.

**We can do better.**  Inspired by the work of [cleanNFT](https://cleannfts.org/) we provide a sorted list of NFT platforms for artists.

### Evaluating new platforms
Some platforms such as Tezos claim to produce [cleaner NFTs](https://medium.com/tqtezos/clean-nfts-on-tezos-58566b2fdba1). We study these claims by estimating the energy consumption of the entire network and then comparing individual platforms.

We hope that this work can be further updated when more accurate data is produced and new platforms are created.


## Taxonomy of NFT solutions by energy consumption
### Contribution
1. Provide an estimation of the amount of energy required to run the blockchain network followed by the expected $kgCO^2$ generated
2. Provide an estimation of the amount of kgCO2 generated by the platform's website
3. Include a way to mint or important information
4. Sort by network with lowest amount of kgCO2 required followed by lowest amount of kgCO2 for its website
### Methodology
We continue the work done by the [ðŸŒ¼ Clean-NFTs Developer Community
](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A-7Ama31sYWhXDl6NoJaXnbAV9pFbjxLIgl7jb3CHOs/edit#gid=0) list and include the energy consumptions and further guides on how to use these platforms. Please note that these are rough estimates meticulously calculated from the network sizes and their recommended specs. 
The estimations are based on:
* conversion from kWh to kgCo2 done with [rensmart](https://www.rensmart.com/Calculators/KWH-to-CO2)
* checking [AWS compute consumption](https://medium.com/teads-engineering/estimating-aws-ec2-instances-power-consumption-c9745e347959)
* website carbon generation is done with [websitecarbon](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) and estimated for a year of use with 10,000 page views a month.
